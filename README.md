# 15-Days-Python-mastering

Bosscoder Academy provides a structured curriculum with daily topics and sets of questions for 15 days. 
I'm diligently working through these materials to enhance my coding skills.
I'm excited to share that I'm diligently following the BossCoder Academy curriculum.
Each day, the academy provides a set of topics to study along with a series of questions to solve, ensuring a hands-on approach to learning. 
I've uploaded the detailed curriculum and the corresponding questions in a PDF format to this GitHub repository. 
You can explore the curriculum, track my progress, and even join me in this learning journey!

Feel free to dive into the curriculum, explore the topics covered, and engage with the questions provided.
